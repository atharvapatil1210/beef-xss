1. Hook the Target Browser

To hook the target browser, you need to deliver the BeEF hook script to the target. This can be done by embedding the hook script in a webpage that the target will visit. The hook script URL is typically:

plaintext

http://<your_beef_server_ip>:3000/hook.js

For example, you can create a simple HTML file with the hook script:

    index.html

Host this HTML file on a web server and have the target visit the URL. Once the target's browser loads the page, it will be hooked by BeEF.

2. Monitor and Control the Hooked Browser

In the BeEF control panel, you will see the hooked browser listed under "Hooked Browsers". Click on the target browser to see detailed information and available command modules.

3. Execute Commands

BeEF provides a wide range of command modules that you can execute on the hooked browser. Some examples include:

    Get Page Source: Retrieve the HTML source code of the current page.
    Keylogger: Capture keystrokes entered in the browser.
    Alert Dialog: Display an alert dialog on the target browser.

Select a command module, configure any required options, and execute the command. Monitor the results in the BeEF control panel.
