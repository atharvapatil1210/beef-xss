1. Host the Malicious Webpage

Host this HTML file on a web server that can be indexed by Google. Ensure that the web server is configured correctly to serve the file and that it is accessible from the internet.
2. Get the Webpage Indexed by Google

To get your malicious webpage indexed by Google, you can use techniques such as:

    Submitting the URL: Use the Google Search Console to submit the URL of your webpage for indexing.
    Backlinking: Create backlinks to your webpage from other sites to improve its visibility and chances of being indexed by Google.
    SEO Techniques: Apply search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to ensure your page appears in search results for specific keywords.

3. Monitor and Control the Hooked Browser

Once your webpage is indexed by Google, wait for the target to perform a Google search and click on the search result that leads to your malicious webpage. When the target's browser loads the page, it will be hooked by BeEF.

In the BeEF control panel, you will see the hooked browser listed under "Hooked Browsers". Click on the target browser to see detailed information and available command modules.
4. Execute Commands

BeEF provides a wide range of command modules that you can execute on the hooked browser. Some examples include:

    Get Page Source: Retrieve the HTML source code of the current page.
    Keylogger: Capture keystrokes entered in the browser.
    Alert Dialog: Display an alert dialog on the target browser.

Select a command module, configure any required options, and execute the command. Monitor the results in the BeEF control panel.
5. Report Findings

Document any vulnerabilities or security issues you discover during your testing. Provide recommendations for mitigating these issues to improve the security of the target system.
