5. Execute Social Engineering Commands

BeEF provides several command modules specifically designed for social engineering attacks. Some examples include:
5.1. Fake Login Page

You can create a fake login page to capture the target's credentials. Use the "Pretty Theft" module to create a fake login form:

    Navigate to the "Commands" tab.
    Select "Social Engineering".
    Choose "Pretty Theft".
    Configure the options (e.g., type of fake login page) and execute the command.

The fake login page will be displayed to the target, and any entered credentials will be captured and displayed in the BeEF control panel.
5.2. Fake Update Notification

You can display a fake update notification to the target to trick them into installing malicious software:

    Navigate to the "Commands" tab.
    Select "Social Engineering".
    Choose "Fake Update".
    Configure the options (e.g., update message, download URL) and execute the command.

The fake update notification will be displayed to the target, and if they click on it, they will be redirected to the specified URL.
6. Report Findings

Document any successful social engineering attacks and the information obtained. Provide recommendations for improving user awareness and security practices to mitigate the risk of social engineering attacks.
