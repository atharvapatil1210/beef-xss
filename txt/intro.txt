BeEF - The Browser Exploitation Framework

BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. 
It is a powerful penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser.

Amid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against clients, 
including mobile clients, 
BeEF allows professional penetration testers to assess the actual security posture of a target environment 
by using client-side attack vectors. 
Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system, and 
examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser.

BeEF will hook one or more web browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context.
Features

    Command Modules: Execute a variety of attacks such as capturing keystrokes, stealing cookies, taking screenshots, and more.
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Highly effective in exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.
    Integration: Can be integrated with other penetration testing tools and frameworks.

Usage

BeEF is designed for ethical hacking and penetration testing, used by security professionals to identify and mitigate browser vulnerabilities. 
It is also a valuable educational tool for teaching and demonstrating browser security issues.
Installation

BeEF is included in many penetration testing distributions like Kali Linux, making it easily accessible for security professionals.
Legal and Ethical Considerations

Always use BeEF responsibly and legally. Ensure you have permission to test the systems and browsers you target.
